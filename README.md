# üìà Real-Time Instruments Dashboard with BLoC

This Flutter project demonstrates real-time financial instrument tracking using BLoC, WebSocket, and REST APIs.

## üß† Event Handling Strategy

We handle distinct event types in a clear and maintainable way using separate `on<Event>` handlers.

### üì¶ Event Types

| Event               | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `LoadInstruments`   | Fetches the full list of instruments from the REST API, initializes WebSocket, and sets up internal cache. |
| `InstrumentUpdated` | Triggered by a WebSocket update; updates the specific instrument using its ID. |

```dart
on<LoadInstruments>(_onLoadInstruments);
on<InstrumentUpdated>(_onInstrumentUpdated);
```

### üß© Strategy Highlights

- **Isolated Handlers**: Each event has a dedicated handler method for clarity.
- **Granular Updates**: Instruments are updated by ID; avoids unnecessary list reprocessing.
- **Internal Cache**: `_cachedInstruments` enables quick state restoration and fast lookup.

## üîÑ Connection Lifecycle Handling

We use [`connectivity_plus`](https://pub.dev/packages/connectivity_plus) to monitor network status and manage reconnection behavior.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Detects changes in network state.
- Automatically reloads instruments on connection restore.
- Clears cache and emits error on disconnection.
- Gracefully cleans up and re-establishes WebSocket streams.

```dart
_connectivitySubscription = Connectivity().onConnectivityChanged.listen((result) {
  if (result != _lastConnectionStatus) {
    _lastConnectionStatus = result;
    if (result == ConnectivityResult.none) {
      _cachedInstruments.clear();
      emit(InstrumentsError("No internet connection"));
    } else {
      add(LoadInstruments());
    }
  }
});
```

## ‚öñÔ∏è Design Trade-Offs

### ‚úÖ Chosen

| Decision | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Internal cache (`_cachedInstruments`) | Enables efficient mutation and avoids full re-fetches. |
| `List.from(...)` when emitting | Prevents shallow mutation issues that can break UI rendering. |
| Stream cleanup in `close()` | Ensures memory-safe shutdown of WebSocket & listeners. |

### ‚ùå Avoided

| Option | Reason for Avoidance |
|--------|----------------------|
| Emitting entire state on every update | Too costly for large lists and inefficient. |
| Union event types or dynamic dispatch | Harder to read, debug, and test. |
| Keeping WebSocket always active | Wasteful during disconnection; breaks user expectations. |

### Q&A
1 - Your strategy for managing and merging the multiple, distinct event types within your BLoC without resorting to complex or unreadable logic.?
- I used Bloc instead for managing successful events and failure, we allowed the UI to deal from the state of the loaded instruments.
- I used Equatable to avoid multiple created instance through overriding props from Equatable class.

2 - How you addressed the connection lifecycle and automatic reconnection requirements.
- Through `connectivity_plus` package, I used it for any change has taken place.
- If there is no connection, the cached instruments will be removed till the internet comes back again.

3- Any significant design trade-offs you made and why.
- I integrated InstrumentModel with PriceModel which it may violate SOLID, but for sake of time, we used it as extension since we focus on performance
same output for each instrument type between Postman and the Flutter app.
